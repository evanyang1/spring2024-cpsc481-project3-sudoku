# Spring 2024 CPSC 481 Project 3 Sudoku AI

This program solves a 2x2 sudoku puzzle ranging from 1-4.

Using `search.py`, we create `sudoku.py` through the class Problem. After defining an actions, result, goal test, and valid action methods, we use algorithms such as depth first search to find a solution to the sudoku problem. 

To run this code, please execute “py sudoku.py”, “python sudoku.py”, or “python3 sudoku.py” in a local terminal within the folder for this github repository.
